### Summary

This project expanded ["hello-world-sdg,"](http://hello-world-sdg-dylanattal.surge.sh/) my first project with Suncoast Developers Guild. The overall goal of this project was to provide more information about a hobby by adding more pages to the website and linking them together. This served as an introduction to `navbar` and anchor tags. In the `footer`, I was able to provide links to other websites that opened in new tabs by adding `target="_blank"` to the anchor tags. I'm proud of figuring out how to implement a sticky `header` and `footer` that do not scroll with the page by adding `position: fixed` to their styling. I also added the `:hover` CSS psuedo-class to my `navbar` and `table`.

### Project Goals

- [x] Create a multi-page site whose pages link to each other
- [x] Use semantic HTML tags to organize content meaningfully
