        <h1>How I Ended up at my Second Studio</h1>
        <p>
          The good things in life never last. Unfortunately, I had to leave the
          Tampa Jiu Jitsu studio despite the community I had found there because
          I moved across town -- and if you should know anything about me, it's
          that I hate sitting in traffic. So I began a search for another jiu
          jitsu studio. To my surprise, there were several reputable jiu jitsu
          studios in the Tampa Bay area. A sucker for convenience, I decided to
          check out the closest one to my new apartment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gracie Tampa turned out to be more intimidating than my last studio.
          ("Gracie" is a subset of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu that was founded by the
          legendary Gracie family). Firstly, Gracie Tampa is more oriented
          towards MMA competition than my previous studio. In fact, several of
          their top students had just participated in a tournament in Abu Dhabi
          when I arrived. I came from a school more focused on practical
          self-defense, so I had to change mindsets a little bit. Secondly,
          Gracie Tampa practices jiu jitsu without the <em>gi</em>. A
          <em>gi</em> is special martial arts attire that allows for many holds
          and chokes. It looks like a robe with baggy pants. So I also had to
          adjust my sparring style, abandoning my habitual use of a cross choke
          and getting used to the monkey grip rather than gripping a sleeve or
          pant leg.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite a lot of hiccups during my first few weeks at the new studio,
          I came to love Gracie Tampa as much as Tampa Jiu Jitsu. It turned out
          that Rob Kahn, the owner and sensei of Gracie Tampa, actually knew my
          former sensei Ryan because they both trained under Royce Gracie. Small
          world! I got accustomed to sparring without my <em>gi</em>, and I even
          bought a rashguard with a beautiful geisha ankle locking a demon
          printed on it. But like I said, all good things come to an end. I got
          busy with work, and I decided to take a break from jiu jitsu. I
          haven't practiced consistently since then. Hopefully I find time to
          start training again, because the benefits were abundant. I kept in
          good shape, but I also ended up making friends, having fun, and
          feeling more centered through the practice.
