      <h1>Some Basic Information about BJJ</h1>
      <p>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is a grappling-based martial art whose central theme is the skill of controlling a
        resisting opponent in ways that force them to submit. The majority of fights end up on the
        ground, so much of the technique of BJJ is centered around the
        skill of taking an opponent down to the ground and wrestling for dominant control positions from where the
        opponent can be subdued.

        To control and overcome greater size and strength with lesser size and strength is the keynote of
        the sport. This is done by utilizing superior leverage, grip, and positioning. Students of the
        sport gain a deep understanding of the workings and limits of the human body.</p>
      <p>Below is a table with five basic techniques that a BJJ beginner
        would expect to learn within the first couple of weeks. The Cross Collar
        Choke used to be my favorite before I started practicing <em>no gi</em>.
